    <h1>BeerGammon Rules</h1>
    
    <p>
        The object of the game is to move all of your checkers around the board to your own home table and then **bear them off into your bunker**. 
        The first player to bear off all of his checkers (have all pieces back in their bunker) wins the game.
    </p>

    <h2>Roll For Number</h2>
    <p>
        Each player has a number that can deal them a drink if rolled. The players start by rolling for their number. 
        Anytime your opponent rolls their number it is your job to **call them on it and they drink**. 
        If you fail to do so, you are **awarded the drink**.
    </p>

    <h2>To Start</h2>
    <p>
        Each player rolls one die and the **higher number goes first**. That player then moves according to the values on the dice.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Entering Checkers</h2>
    <p>
        You enter a checker by placing it on a point in the board corresponding to a number rolled. For example, if you roll **6-3**, 
        then you enter one checker on the six-point and one checker on the three-point. Once you have entered one or more checkers, 
        you may use subsequent rolls to move those checkers forward, to enter more checkers, or both.
    </p>

    <h2>Movement</h2>
    <p>
        The roll of the dice indicates how many points, or pips, the player is to move his checkers. The following rules apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A checker may be moved only to an **open point**, one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers.</li>
        <li>The numbers on the two dice constitute **separate moves**. For example, if you roll 5 and 3, you may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open point, or you may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an open point, but only if the intermediate point (either three or five spaces from the starting point) is also open.</li>
        <li>**Doubles are played twice**. For example, a roll of 6-6 means you have four sixes to use.</li>
        <li>You must use **both numbers of a roll if possible**, or all four numbers in the case of doubles.</li>
        <li>**Acey-deucey**: The roll of 1 and 2 (acey-deucey) is especially valuable. When you roll 1-2, you **name any roll of doubles you wish** and play it accordingly.</li>
        <li>**Doubles - Roll Again**: After taking your 4 moves with doubles, the player **rolls again**.</li>
        <li>**Final Quadrant Restriction**: Once a piece is moved into the final quadrant, it can only move again once **all 15 pieces** are also in that quadrant (or moved in). Additionally, pieces **must bear off with the exact number** of the roll.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pokeying</h2>
    <p>
        A checker sitting alone on a point is called a **blot**. If an opposing checker lands on a blot, the blot is **hit** and placed on **pokey**.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Getting Off Pokey</h2>
    <p>
        Any time you have one or more checkers on pokey, you have to reenter them on the board before moving any other pieces. 
        You reenter a checker by **rolling doubles** and moving it to an open point corresponding to one of the numbers on the rolled dice.
    </p>

    <h2>Bearing Off/Moving In</h2>
    <p>
        Once you have moved all fifteen of your checkers into your opponent's home board, you may begin bearing off. 
        You bear off a checker by rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which it resides, then removing the checker from the board.
    </p>

    <h2>Drinks üç∫</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Drink 1** any time your opponent rolls doubles.</li>
        <li>**Drink** any time you have a move you are blocked from taking (e.g., being unable to leave pokey, get past opponent's pieces, or not having a piece to bear off).</li>
        <li>**Drink 1** if your dice are rolled in a sloppy manner (must be called out by the opponent).</li>
    </ul>
